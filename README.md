Administrative controls – A “Manage Products” section lets you add new candles (name, price, description, image URL) or remove existing ones. All changes are stored locally, so you can refresh without losing edits.

Order handling – Customers can enter their name, email and address and submit an order. For demonstration purposes the form displays a confirmation message; you can integrate it with a backend or email service later.
